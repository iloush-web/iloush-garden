      <p>Hi! It’s been a while since I last posted.</p>
      <p>So much has been going on - uni, my film project, friends... and a lot of stress about exams and coursework.
      </p>

      <p>At the start of December, I defended my course project on setting up a computer network in Packet Tracer -
        configuring VLANs, DHCP servers, web servers, NAT, and dynamic routing.</p>
      <p>I got 5/5!!</p>
      <p>I was so stressed about presenting it, but everything went well!</p>

      <p>As for my documentary film — I showed the first drafts to my teacher. He said it doesn’t look like a real film
        (yet), but for my first time making one, it’s okay. He also said the footage was beautiful.</p>

      <p>Now I’m trying to finish the editing, because we have a group presentation coming up. We’ll watch each other’s
        documentaries and discuss them.</p>

      <p>I feel like uni tasks are endless!</p>

      <p>Today I suddenly remembered about the exam assignment for web technologies… oops.</p>

      <p>BUT - it’s almost NEW YEAR, and I’d rather be wrapping gifts, decorating, and watching series in bed.</p>

      <p>And I want to show you some photos on my new camera! (I will tell you more about it soon)</p>
