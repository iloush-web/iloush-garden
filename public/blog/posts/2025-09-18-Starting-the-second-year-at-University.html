The first week made one thing clear: <strong>this semester is going to be intense.</strong>
</p>

The schedule is packed, all the subjects are challenging, and there's never enough time to finish assignments. Math especially scared me — I feel like my basics aren't strong enough to keep up with new topics. Differential equations without solid integration skills? That's rough.
I'm trying to catch up now because a midterm is coming soon, but we're moving so fast in class that it's hard to keep track.

<p>
There are also a lot of lab assignments — and even if you do everything carefully, almost none of them pass on the first try. You always have to make corrections. Of course, that's frustrating.
</p>

<p>
Then, during project sign-up (at my university, you choose a year-long project), the website crashed. The server was down, loading endlessly or not responding at all. I didn't manage to submit my application for the project I wanted — the one I planned to join with my friend. She made it in time; I didn't. By the time the site loaded for me, most spots were taken. So I decided to go with what truly called to me instead.

I found a <strong>project about making documentary films.</strong> Yes — even though I'm studying IT, I managed to apply.
</p>

<p>
And I did. I submitted my application.
</p>

<p>
Recently, I attended the first meeting, and now I'm not sure if I made the right choice. This project will be demanding and emotionally exhausting. We'll work either alone or in pairs, and by the end of the semester, each group or person must present their own short documentary. During the week, I'll need to find time to talk to scientists at the university, film them, and piece together a story.
I have some experience with video editing and shooting, but still… I'm afraid I won't be able to carry it through.

That's where things stand with my studies right now.
I hope that soon I'll get everything sorted out — and life will feel a little calmer.
